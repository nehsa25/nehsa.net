                    I've spent much of my professional career in conversations, meetups, and conferences about Agile and
                    project management. The project management processes are as important as the coding itself to ensure
                    we're building the right thing and at the highest level of quality.<br><br>

                    I have assisted several organizations in moving from waterfall processes to Agile development
                    practices or at least to more iterative development patterns. Often, I see organizations spend a
                    long time in a hybrid "mini-waterfall" state. The desire is to "be Agile," but there's a fear of
                    drastically changing from known procedures, so we end up in a hybrid state. We're releasing more
                    frequently, but the structure of the teams and processes remain much the same. Hence, we have the
                    same problems and deficits in quality.<br><br>

                    I make the following delineation:<br>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Waterfall</dt>
                        <dd>Linear development of a large set of features. The features are designed, developed, and
                            then tested, and only when everything is ready does a "release" occur.</dd>
                        <dt>Mini-waterfall</dt>
                        <dd>Is essentially the same as a waterfall, but with more frequent
                            releases (i.e., perhaps quarterly instead of yearly). The development process remains
                            linear, and teams
                            are still segregated. This distinction helps to clarify the nuances between the two styles,
                            ensuring
                            a deeper understanding of the iterative development landscape. We're not utiliziing all the
                            processes that allow us to "be Agile."</dd>
                        <dt>Iterative/Agile</dt>
                        <dd>Only a few key elements are needed for a successful iterative development:
                            <ul class="condensed">
                                <li>Self-contained teamsâ€”One critical element for successful iterative development is
                                    the team's structure. When team members are split across projects, the quality and
                                    velocity of
                                    work suffer. For instance, expecting a tester to deliver thorough validation and
                                    find bugs at the end of a sprint when their focus has been elsewhere or they were
                                    not included in elaboration is a recipe for disappointment and subpar outcomes.</li>
                                <li>Features are broken up into user stories. "As a portal user, I need to
                                    download X from Y." This allows development to focus solely on fulfilling this
                                    requirement,
                                    and once
                                    tested, the story can be released in isolation and provide value to the end user.
                                </li>
                                <li>Stories are sized via story points, not development hours. The reason:
                                    While development hours and story points may seem similar (I've been at
                                    organizations that insisted on a 1 story point = 4 development hours silliness, for
                                    example). This shows a misunderstanding of the purpose of story points.<br><br>

                                    Development hours are provided by a developer with detailed knowledge of the
                                    underlying code. He imagines the code in his head and goes, "Well, Bob, I believe
                                    that's about 4 hours of development."<br><br>

                                    All is well and good, except how much testing is then needed? Does it require a lot
                                    of documentation? Training? A developer coding task may be minor but have huge
                                    testing
                                    implications.<br><br>

                                    Story points have a new name because they're intended to differ from development
                                    hours. They focus on relative complexity, and require no knowledge of the code
                                    itself. All members of the team may
                                    not be able to
                                    speak to the development hours of a feature written in a complex coding language,
                                    but if the team as a whole worked on user story "A" and is now tasked to develop
                                    user story "B," they can make some correlations:<br><br>

                                    Well, if user story "A" was 3 points, story "B" would be 5 - more data validation is
                                    required, and we'll need to train the support team. Now, regardless of their
                                    knowledge of the actual code, every team member can participate in planning. The
                                    number we come up with is the "DONE DONE" number - the story has been developed and
                                    tested!<br><br>

                                    Story points get a bad rap. For example, I see the memes of using 20-sided dice to
                                    determine story points. Still, when used correctly, they can help the team reach
                                    common ground for discussing the complexity of a feature.
                                </li>
                                <li>Stories are prioritized in a groomed backlog. We take from the top for each release
                                    (sprint)
                                    until
                                    the sprint is full. If the team is ahead of schedule, they can pull in additional
                                    stories
                                    during
                                    the
                                    sprint; if behind schedule, anything not complete at the end of the sprint goes back
                                    into
                                    the
                                    backlog to be prioritized again.</li>
                                <li>Stories, once started are completed before moving on</li>
                                <li>Burn down is key. This is a burn down of story points within a sprint and is the
                                    best
                                    indication if changes are required to make deadlines with high quality. As stories
                                    are worked to completion and "DONE DONE" when complete, we can subtract their story
                                    points from the total allocated from teh sprint and have a perfect indication if
                                    we're on track. A good burn-down is a consistent </li>

                    <span class="importantish">Do not split test tasks from development tasks. It's solely a means to
                        trick ourselves into

                        tested. At best splitting testing makes metrics *appear* better, at worst, it
                        causes less testing to occur as once testing tasks are broken out from the feature, it's
                        easy to
