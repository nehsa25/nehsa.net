                First, please excuse my mess! I think of this website as a sort of diary—it's where I record any new
                knowledge
                I've acquired during my day. So, if you see something that looks broken, it's because I'm in the middle
                of learning
                something new. Thanks for your understanding!<br><br>

                I have always wanted a nerdy website with random quotes and a personal blog and BAM! Dreams do come
                true.<br><br>

                                    they?
                                    Around here, the best time to get those big, beautiful blooms going is usually
                                    mid-May. We want to make sure the last frost has passed. Once the ground's
                                    warmed up
                                    a bit, those little sunflower seeds will pop right out.
                                    But hey, every yard's a little different. If you're worried about a late frost,
                                    you
                                    might want to wait until June. Just keep an eye on the weather!</span>
