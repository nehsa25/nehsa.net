                        <p>Although I see the allure of CSS frameworks, which focus on atomic/single-use utility
                            classes (they allow you to add them to an element to change its styling).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, in TailWind CSS, you can add the "items-center" class to a parent element to
                            center the elements within it.
                            This approach does have some limitations. For example, it's common to end up with
                            inconsistent styling because you've left one-of-many classes off of an element.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Leveraging semantic and custom HTML elements where possible is a superior strategy. This
                            approach offers reusable components with consistent styling, enhancing the overall user
                            experience.<br> <br>

                            For example, instead of: <inline-code>&lt;span class="code text-white
                                font-bold"&gt;CODE&lt;/span&gt;</inline-code><br>

                            I would create: <inline-code>&lt;inline-code&gt;CODE&lt;/inline-code&gt;</inline-code> <br>
                            <br>

                            Doing this gives me two classes:<br>
                            &lt;code&gt; - For multiline code blocks which I want to start on a new line<br>
                            &lt;inline-code&gt; - For small code snippets that I wish to be on the same line<br><br>

                            It's worth noting that some frameworks, like Angular, may not support custom elements by
                            default. However, you can still use them by following these steps: Refer to the 'Custom
                            Elements' section <a routerLink="/angular">here</a> for detailed instructions.
