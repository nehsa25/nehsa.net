                        <p>I was stagnating at my current employer, which I had been with for seven years, and needed a
                            fresh start. I signed up for a paid LinkedIn subscription and began exploring the new
                            opportunities available.</p>

                        <p>A few months later, after discovering an exciting new
                            opportunity, I reflected on the
                            experience. What immediately comes to mind: <important-med>LinkedIn sucks.</important-med>
                        </p>

                        <p>LinkedIn did not produce interviews. The problems with LinkedIn were two-fold:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>It's too big. It's too popular. TOO MANY PEOPLE.</li>
                            <li>The "EASY" submit feature was too easy. It allows for too many applications, too
                                quickly. A new job posting might get hundreds of applications within minutes of the
                                post.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>None of the "premium" services offers such as the ability to indicate a job is a "Top Choice"
                            offset these systemic issues.</p>

                        <p>At the same time I paid for a subscription at LinkedIn, I also updated my resume on a free version of Indeed. This generated every fruitful
                            conversation in the end.</p>

                        <p>Indeed, it is the clear winner in my head. The day I officially accepted my offer from the
                            new employer, I canceled my paid subscription to LinkedIn and have no plans to return.</p>
