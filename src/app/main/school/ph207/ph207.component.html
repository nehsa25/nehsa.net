                            For example, the curved spacetime around Earth causes a ball to accelerate towards the

                                            they can
                                            detect its influence by observing how its gravity bends and distorts
                                            light from
                                            more-distant objects. This observation arises because galaxies could not

                                            formed as they have, or rotate as they are seen to, unless they contain

                                <li>Astronomical Units (AU): Astronomical units, abbreviated AU, are a useful unit
                                    of
                                    measure within our solar system. One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth's
                                    orbit,
                                    which is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). When measured in
                                    astronomical
                                    units, the 886,000,000-mile (1,400,000,000-kilometer) distance from the Sun to
                                    Saturn's
                                    orbit, is a much more manageable 9.5 AU. So astronomical units are a great way
                                    to
                                    compress truly astronomical numbers to a more manageable size.

                                    Astronomical units also make it easy to think about distances between solar
                                    system
                                    objects. They make it easy to see that Jupiter orbits five times farther from
                                    the Sun
                                    than Earth, and that Saturn is twice as far from the Sun as Jupiter.</li>
                                <li>Light Years: For much greater distances — interstellar distances — astronomers
                                    use light
                                    years. A light year is the distance a photon of light travels in one year, which
                                    is
                                    about 6 trillion miles (9 trillion kilometers, or 63,000 AU). Put another way, a
                                    light
                                    year is how far you'd travel in a year if you could travel at the speed of
                                    light, which
                                    is 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second. For example, the nearest star
                                    system
                                    to ours is the triple star system of Alpha Centauri, at about 4.3 light years
                                    away.
                                    That's a more manageable number than 25 trillion miles, 40 trillion kilometers
                                    or
                                    272,000 AU.</li>

                            Speak of light as particles instead of waves such as photons. Light is all light, not
                            only visible. As you send electricity down tube of gas.
                            Gases have a structure of nucleons and electrons and the electrons can take excited
                            states.
                            When electrons take excited states, they drop down to lower energy emitting a photon of
                            light.
                            The electron energy states are quontry states (they can only take certain energy and
                            emit only certain entery).

                    <ol>
                        <li>The date and time</li>
                        <li>Location: What is your longitude and latitude?</li>
                        <li>Seeing conditions: How clear is the sky? Is it foggy, partly cloudy, etc. Are you in the
                            city or
                            a rural setting? What is the light pollution?</li>
                        <li>Locate the Big Dipper and North Star. First, get oriented with the night sky. Figure out
                            which
                            direction is north, by finding the Big Dipper. The “front” two stars of the Big Dipper
                            point to
                            the star at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, which is Polaris, or the North
                            Star. The
                            Big Dipper rotates around the celestial north pole through the night, but Polaris is
                            always in
                            the direction of north. Make a note of the orientation of the Big Dipper in the sky.
                            Measure how
                            high Polaris is in the sky. A convenient way to do this is to hold out your fist at
                            arm’s length
                            and count how many “fists” lie between the horizon and Polaris. Each fist is about ten
                            degrees
                            90 degrees should be straight up. (If you live in the southern hemisphere, you will
                            orient your
                            viewing similarly, but with respect to the Southern Cross.)</li>
                        <li>Choose a constellation to follow through the term. Find the constellation on your star
                            finder,
                            and then locate your chosen constellation in the night sky. Do this each night that you
                            observe
                            the sky. Note the location and orientation of the constellation by reporting its
                            direction and
                            inclination angle. Since you have located north, you should be able to approximate the
                            direction
                            (NNE, NE, ENE, etc.) and how many degrees above the horizon (inclination angle) your
                            constellation is located.</li>
                        <li>Locate a second constellation (a different one each time). Similarly report its location
                            and
                            orientation.</li>
                        <li>Is the moon visible? What is its phase? Report its orientation and location.</li>
                        <li>Give any other details. For example, is the Milky Way visible? What planets can you
                            locate? Do
                            you see
                            any satellites? Meteor showers?</li>
