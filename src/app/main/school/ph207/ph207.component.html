                        warping spacetime. The more massive an object is, the more it warps the space around it.
                        For example, the curved spacetime around Earth causes a ball to accelerate towards the
                        ground.</dd>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Astronomical Units (AU): Astronomical units, abbreviated AU, are a useful unit of
                                measure within our solar system. One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth's orbit,
                                which is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). When measured in astronomical
                                units, the 886,000,000-mile (1,400,000,000-kilometer) distance from the Sun to Saturn's
                                orbit, is a much more manageable 9.5 AU. So astronomical units are a great way to
                                compress truly astronomical numbers to a more manageable size.

                                Astronomical units also make it easy to think about distances between solar system
                                objects. They make it easy to see that Jupiter orbits five times farther from the Sun
                                than Earth, and that Saturn is twice as far from the Sun as Jupiter.</li>
                            <li>Light Years: For much greater distances — interstellar distances — astronomers use light
                                years. A light year is the distance a photon of light travels in one year, which is
                                about 6 trillion miles (9 trillion kilometers, or 63,000 AU). Put another way, a light
                                year is how far you'd travel in a year if you could travel at the speed of light, which
                                is 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second. For example, the nearest star system
                                to ours is the triple star system of Alpha Centauri, at about 4.3 light years away.
                                That's a more manageable number than 25 trillion miles, 40 trillion kilometers or
                                272,000 AU.</li>
                            <li>Parsecs: This is the unit used when the number of light years between objects climbs

                        Speak of light as particles instead of waves such as photons. Light is all light, not
                        only visible. As you send electricity down tube of gas.
                        Gases have a structure of nucleons and electrons and the electrons can take excited
                        states.
                        When electrons take excited states, they drop down to lower energy emitting a photon of
                        light.
                        The electron energy states are quontry states (they can only take certain energy and
                        emit only certain entery).

                                            direction at 30mph, an observer would see the rock traveling at 40mph. I
                                            would see the rock traveling at 30mph. This isn't the same with speed of
                                            light, all observers would measure c (it cannot be faster). EVERYTHING IS c!

                    <li>Locate the Big Dipper and North Star. First, get oriented with the night sky. Figure out which
                        direction is north, by finding the Big Dipper. The “front” two stars of the Big Dipper point to
                        the star at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, which is Polaris, or the North Star. The
                        Big Dipper rotates around the celestial north pole through the night, but Polaris is always in
                        the direction of north. Make a note of the orientation of the Big Dipper in the sky. Measure how
                        high Polaris is in the sky. A convenient way to do this is to hold out your fist at arm’s length
                        and count how many “fists” lie between the horizon and Polaris. Each fist is about ten degrees
                        90 degrees should be straight up. (If you live in the southern hemisphere, you will orient your
                        viewing similarly, but with respect to the Southern Cross.)</li>
                    <li>Choose a constellation to follow through the term. Find the constellation on your star finder,
                        and then locate your chosen constellation in the night sky. Do this each night that you observe
                        the sky. Note the location and orientation of the constellation by reporting its direction and
                        inclination angle. Since you have located north, you should be able to approximate the direction
                        (NNE, NE, ENE, etc.) and how many degrees above the horizon (inclination angle) your
                        constellation is located.</li>
                    <li>Locate a second constellation (a different one each time). Similarly report its location and
