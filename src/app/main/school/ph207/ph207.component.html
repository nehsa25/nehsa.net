                <h3>Night Sky Journal</h3>
                Journal Entry Instructions
                For each journal entry, include:
                <ol>
                    <li>The date and time</li>
                    <li>Location: What is your longitude and latitude?</li>
                    <li>Seeing conditions: How clear is the sky? Is it foggy, partly cloudy, etc. Are you in the city or
                        a rural setting? What is the light pollution?</li>
                    <li>Locate the Big Dipper and North Star. First, get oriented with the night sky. Figure out which
                        direction is north, by finding the Big Dipper. The “front” two stars of the Big Dipper point to
                        the star at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, which is Polaris, or the North Star. The
                        Big Dipper rotates around the celestial north pole through the night, but Polaris is always in
                        the direction of north. Make a note of the orientation of the Big Dipper in the sky. Measure how
                        high Polaris is in the sky. A convenient way to do this is to hold out your fist at arm’s length
                        and count how many “fists” lie between the horizon and Polaris. Each fist is about ten degrees
                        90 degrees should be straight up. (If you live in the southern hemisphere, you will orient your
                        viewing similarly, but with respect to the Southern Cross.)</li>
                    <li>Choose a constellation to follow through the term. Find the constellation on your star finder,
                        and then locate your chosen constellation in the night sky. Do this each night that you observe
                        the sky. Note the location and orientation of the constellation by reporting its direction and
                        inclination angle. Since you have located north, you should be able to approximate the direction
                        (NNE, NE, ENE, etc.) and how many degrees above the horizon (inclination angle) your
                        constellation is located.</li>
                    <li>Locate a second constellation (a different one each time). Similarly report its location and
                        orientation.</li>
                    <li>Is the moon visible? What is its phase? Report its orientation and location.</li>
                    <li>Give any other details. For example, is the Milky Way visible? What planets can you locate? Do
                        you see
                        any satellites? Meteor showers?</li>
