                <span class="summary">I stopped pursuing my education in my early twenties to take care of a new family.
                    I was lucky, and this did not prevent me from having a unique and fulfilling career in the industry
                    I loveâ€”software engineering.<br><br>

                    I've worked for large organizations (Intel, The Standard), medium-sized organizations with a
                    start-up feel (Webtrends), and small organizations (TenAsys, CASEY). I enjoyed all my experience in
                    testing, development, leadership and management, project management, DevOps, and security. And most
                    importantly, I've had the opportunity to work with amazing and often brilliant people.<br><br>

                    While my unfinished education didn't hinder my career growth, I've always felt a need to someday
                    complete my education. I'm determined to finish what I started and have enrolled in Oregon State's
                    Computer Science program to achieve this goal! Slowly..</span>

                            <dd> - This course covers three main topics: galaxies and their evolution; cosmology
                                including the
                                big bang,
                                evolution and large-scale structure of the universe; and fundamentals of life including
                                the
                                prospect of
                                finding life beyond planet Earth. Background information, such as fundamentals of
